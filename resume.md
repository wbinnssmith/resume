## Experience
### Bonobos, Inc. (Dec. 2012 — Present)

__Fullstack engineer__ with a frontend passion. I began with Bonobos in our Palo Alto, California office and soon relocated to NYC to build our technology team from 2 engineers to a team of 20+.

* Developed all of the frontend build and infrastructure in node using Browserify & CommonJS modules for our next-generation platform. Our women's line, [AYR](http://ayr.com), and soon Bonobos, is a 100% JavaScript Backbone.js client to our ecommerce platform.

* Prior to my work on the new frontends, I developed much of the frontend shopping cart functionality on bonobos.com, which eliminated a full page load from the store and raised customer average order value by 8%.

* Worked one-on-one with designers to bring a desktop-viewport only website to one that's optimized for smaller, touch-based devices.

### Mozes, Inc. (Sept. 2011 — Dec. 2012)

__Software engineer__ for our mobile engagement and marketing platform. 

* Built a JavaScript-rich web client for our scheduling system, from scratch, using backbone.js.  

* Extended our previously SMS-centric mobile sweepstakes infrastructure to accommodate entries from the mobile web. This enabled our team to quickly deploy new scratch-and-win lottery contests.

### ComplianceBridge Corp. (June 2010 — Sept. 2011)
__Software & Systems Engineer__

## Side Projects & Open Source
