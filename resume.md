## Experience
### Atlassian, Inc. (Oct. 2014 - Present)

__Frontend Developer__ on the Bitbucket team.

* Developed a single-page Backbone Marionette frontend to our git-backed "Snippets" feature — much like GitHub's gists — and the API endpoints in django to integrate with our git backends.

* Made Atlassian's cross-product component library, AUI, compatible with CommonJS bundlers and worked regularly with our Design Platform team in Sydney to publish it to npm as a single package with many individual modules.

* Co-authored Bitbucket's implementation of Atlassian Connect, a plugin architecture for our cloud products which uses the `postMessage` API to securely communicate between Bitbucket and embedded plugin frames.

* Migrated Bitbucket's frontend build process from over 950 AMD modules and bower dependencies to one built with webpack and modules from npm.

### Bonobos, Inc. (Dec. 2012 — Sept. 2014)

__Fullstack software engineer__ with a frontend passion. I began with Bonobos in our Palo Alto, California office and soon relocated to NYC to build our technology team from 2 engineers to a team of 20+.

* Developed frontend app architecture and user interface components as CommonJS modules using Backbone and Browserify for both Bonobos and [AYR](http://ayr.com), our women's line.

* Developed interactive side-drawer web frontend for the shopping cart functionality on bonobos.com, which eliminated a full page load from the store and raised customer average order value by 8%.

* Worked one-on-one with designers to bring a desktop-viewport only website to one that's optimized for smaller, touch-based devices.

### Mozes, Inc. (Sept. 2011 — Dec. 2012)
__Software engineer__ for our mobile engagement and marketing platform.

### ComplianceBridge Corp. (June 2010 — Sept. 2011)
__Software & Systems Engineer__

## Side Projects & Open Source

Check out [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/wbinnssmith). I love building and contributing to projects that involve frontend build automation, source code transformation, emerging standards like web components, and libraries that make me think differently. Also ridiculous but entertaining things like emoji.
